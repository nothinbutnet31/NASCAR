            <strong>Midge's Mighty Men:</strong><br><br>
            <p>
            Midge’s Mighty Men roll into the opening 12‑race stretch looking like a team built for both weekly stability and explosive upside. William Byron gives them a true hammer up top — a pole‑winning, stage‑snatching,
            mile‑and‑a‑half assassin who can stack early points in bunches. Denny Hamlin brings the Toyota counterpunch, a veteran who thrives in the spring grind and almost always finds a way to steal a win before the All‑Star
            break. Ryan Blaney adds championship‑level composure and Ford horsepower, especially valuable at the drafting tracks and intermediates that dominate the early calendar. Ryan Preece is the blue‑collar wildcard,
            capable of sneaking top‑15s on short tracks and superspeedways when chaos hits. And then there’s Shane van Gisbergen — the ultimate swing pick. If the schedule throws a road course or a plate‑style melee into 
            the first dozen races, SVG can turn a mid‑pack week into a knockout blow. Altogether, this roster feels like a quiet juggernaut: steady floor, sneaky ceiling, and the kind of lineup that can sit top‑three in points
            before anyone realizes what Midge is cooking.

            <strong>Emilia's Speeder Blaze:</strong><br><br>
                        <p>
            Emilia’s Speeder Blaze enters the first 12‑race sprint with a roster built on redemption arcs, quiet killers, and a couple of drivers who can absolutely break a race wide open. Chase Elliott is the
            anchor — a former champ hungry to reassert himself, especially dangerous on road courses and the early‑season intermediates where he tends to find rhythm. Chase Briscoe, is a massive upside play:
            JGR speed plus his short‑track craft gives this team a legitimate weekly threat. Chris Buescher remains the steady heartbeat, a driver who rarely makes mistakes and can grind out top‑10s even on off‑days.
            Daniel Suárez, now with Spire, brings volatility in the best way — when the car is right, he can punch above his weight and steal big points. And Josh Berry in the Wood Brothers Ford adds a fascinating 
            wildcard: old‑school racecraft, short‑track grit, and the potential to surprise on worn‑out surfaces. Speeder Blaze feels like a team built for momentum swings — if they catch fire early, they can absolutely
            bully their way into the top tier of the standings.

            <strong>Heather's Heroes:</strong><br><br>
            <p>
            Heather’s Heroes look like a team built for pure weekly punch — a roster stacked with drivers who can win anywhere and don’t need perfect circumstances to do it. William Byron sets the tone with his early‑season
            speed and ability to control races from the front. Tyler Reddick brings that high‑commitment, high‑reward style that shines on tracks where precision and bravery matter. Ryan Blaney adds championship‑level 
            steadiness, giving this lineup a reliable backbone even when the chaos hits. Austin Dillon becomes the opportunist of the group, capable of turning superspeedways and attrition‑heavy races into sneaky points 
            hauls. And Kyle Busch rounds out the squad with veteran swagger and race‑craft that can still flip a mediocre weekend into a top‑five. Heather’s Heroes feel like a team built to strike early and often — if they 
            find rhythm in the first month, they’ll be a nightmare for the rest of the league.

            <strong>Danno's Sunday Drivers:</strong><br><br>
                        <p>
           Danno’s Sunday Drivers roll into the opening 12‑race stretch with a lineup that blends elite weekly firepower with some fascinating swing‑for‑the‑fences upside. William Byron is the unquestioned anchor — a driver who
            can stack stage points, dominate intermediates, and set the tone for this roster every single week. Christopher Bell brings the Toyota precision and short‑track sharpness that makes him dangerous anywhere rhythm
            matters, giving this team a second legitimate race‑winning threat. Ryan Blaney adds championship‑level steadiness, the kind of driver who quietly piles up top‑10s even when the car isn’t perfect. Austin Cindric 
            becomes the superspeedway specialist and early‑season wildcard, capable of turning Daytona, Atlanta, or Talladega into massive points hauls. And Noah Gragson rounds out the squad with pure volatility — aggressive,
            hungry, and fully capable of punching above his equipment on the right day. Altogether, Sunday Drivers feel like a team built to pounce: high floor, high ceiling, and the kind of roster that can swing a matchup
            with one explosive weekend.

            <strong>Grace's Stitch Swifties:</strong><br><br>
                        <p>
            Grace’s Stitch Swifties roll into the first 12 races with a lineup that feels equal parts swagger, stability, and pure chaos potential — the exact kind of roster that can go from “solid” to 
            “unstoppable” in a single weekend. Kyle Larson is the engine of the whole operation, a weekly win threat who can dominate anywhere from intermediates to road courses to dirt. Bubba Wallace brings 
            consistent top‑10 speed on the bigger tracks and has become one of the most reliable superspeedway performers in the field. Kyle Busch adds veteran bite and race‑craft that can still turn a messy 
            day into a top‑five, giving this team a second true ceiling‑raiser. Brad Keselowski provides the steady, methodical presence — a points‑gathering machine who thrives on discipline and long‑run pace.
            And Daniel Suárez rounds out the squad with unpredictable upside, capable of punching above his equipment and stealing big points when the setup hits. Stitch Swifties feel like a team built for 
            momentum swings and big‑week explosions — if Larson sets the tone early, the rest of the roster has the firepower to follow him straight up the standings.

                        <p>
            Edmund’s Pet Pitcrew shows up looking like a team built for controlled aggression, raw talent, and the kind of upside that can absolutely warp the standings if the kids hit early. Kyle Larson is the
            nuclear core — a weekly win threat who can erase a bad lineup week single‑handedly. Christopher Bell brings precision and short‑track mastery, giving this roster a second anchor who thrives in the early‑season
            rhythm tracks. Ryan Blaney adds championship‑level stability, the steady heartbeat that keeps the floor high even when the gambles don’t land. Then come the rookies: Connor Zilisch, the prodigy with road‑course
            brilliance and zero fear, and Carson Hocevar, the chaos agent with aggression, swagger, and the potential to steal big points on days when the veterans implode. Pet Pitcrew feels like a team built for fireworks 
            — elite anchors up top, fearless youth at the bottom, and the kind of volatility that can turn a quiet week into a statement win.
